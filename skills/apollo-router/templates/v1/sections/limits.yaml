# Operation Limits (v1.17+ and v2 — identical schema)
# Tip: Start with warn_only: true to observe real traffic, then enforce.
# Router default for max_depth is 100; 50 is a balanced starting point.
# For v1 < 1.17, use `preview_operation_limits` instead of `limits`.

  http_max_request_bytes: 2000000
  max_depth: 50
  max_height: 200
  max_aliases: 30
  max_root_fields: 20
  # warn_only: true  # Uncomment during initial rollout to log without rejecting
